ABOUT ME
My name is Jason Sidhu, a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo and the creator of Premier League Hub.

As a football fan, I wanted to create something that I felt passionate about while testing my skills in creating a full-stack web application. I wanted to create a platform that offers everything a Premier League fan could want in one place.

I created this site to test my full-stack web development abilities. Using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), I have been able to use:
Node.js for server-side development and used it to serve as the backend for my React-based web application
Express.js framework to create a RESTful API and handle HTTP requests and routes
MongoDB and mongoose to create models and schemas to create, read, update, and delete user data
JWT to authenticate users and ensure data is exchanged safely between the front and back-end.
Bcrypt to encrypt user passwords before storing them in the database
Use a caching mechanism to optimize API calls and reduce repeated API requests
